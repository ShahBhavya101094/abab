# ABAB Management System 
This Online ABAB Management System Project in PHP, in particular, primarily concentrates on the management and booking sides of ABABs. To be more explicit, the system facilitates online registration and ABAB room reservations for members. Additionally, the system has tools for managing rooms as well as all of the members. 
The system also enables the administration of course, room, and member registration. Evidently, this project has both a member panel and an admin panel. Registered members can easily book ABAB rooms and view the details of booked rooms in an overview of this web application. The member must choose a room number, ABAB amenities, length of stay, personal information, and more while making a ABAB reservation. After choosing any of the available room numbers, the system in this case instantly notifies the member of any available seats. The member can also check information about their room, such as the room number, amenities, total cost, length of stay, and more.
